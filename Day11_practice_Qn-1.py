'''
You are developing a weather logging system for a travel blog that keeps track of weather conditions during trips. Each weather record includes the city name, date of observation (in the format “dd-mm-yyyy”), temperature (in Celsius), and a short weather description (e.g., “Sunny”, “Rainy”).

Your task is to:

1.  Create a Python module named weatherdata.py that contains a function returning a weather record as a dictionary.

2.  In the main file, import this function and create a list of at least 3 weather records.

3.  For each record:

Convert the date string into a datetime object.

Format the date as “Month Day, Year” (e.g., “March 10, 2024”).

4.  Convert the list of weather records into a JSON string and print it.

5.  Parse the JSON string back into Python objects and display each record clearly on a new line.
