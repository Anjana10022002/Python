Question: Student Name Tracker

Create a Python program that:

Starts with a list of student names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"].

Has a function add_student(name) to add a new student to the list.

Has a function remove_last_student() to remove the last student from the list.

Uses a lambda function to print each student in the format: "Student: <name>".

Includes a recursive function count_total_letters(names) that returns the total number of letters in all student names combined.

def add_student():
    student.append()

def remove_last_student():
    student,pop()
